## [ＰＪＳＭＰ (RE)](https://nan-nan-sempai.github.io/PJSMP)
Site where ＰＪＳＭＰ updates are goning to be posted, Pastebin is censoring some scripts, so i made my own site.

This is the new version of ＰＪＳＭＰ - Pure JavaScript Midi Player, ＰＪＳＭＰ (RE).

(RE) means Remake.

ＰＪＳＭＰ (RE) is a midi player for multiplayer piano, it is modular so each module operate different functions.
